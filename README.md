# 💊 Medicine Catalog

This is a full-stack web application I built to manage a catalog of medicines. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and search medicines with ease. The frontend is built using **React**, and the backend is powered by **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB Atlas**. The app is deployed on **Vercel** (frontend) and **Render** (backend).
